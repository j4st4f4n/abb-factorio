## TODO'S

- Test websocket.io and the api /part request
- Generate correct data models: since no real example data was provided, final data format might be different.
- Backend needs a more realistic implementation.
- The way we show the part features can be improved (styles)
- Add new Views and React Router to show all the robot parts.
